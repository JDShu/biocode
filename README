Pygame is needed to run.
To run, make run.py executable and run it.

The basic idea is that you create custom spliced creatures by using the arrows.

Click on the bottom edge of the screen to spawn a creature. It will move on its own and
damage enemy creatures and opponents depending on how it was configured. When it walks
into the enemy side (the top) the opponent gets damaged. Similarly when their creatures
walk into your side (bottom). Game ends an one player has zero or less health.
